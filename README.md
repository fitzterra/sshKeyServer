**NOTE**: This project has been replaced (*finally*) by this:
https://github.com/fitzterra/sshPubKeyServer

I'm keeping this here for now since there was a lot of effort put in to formalise the infrastructure and layout of a typical Cherrypy app, and maybe I want to come back to this again future. This is probably also the reason this project was never completed ;-)

Basic Key Server for public SSH keys
====================================

This project will be a basic keyserver to store and retrieve public SSH keys
and manage them on a domain/host/user hierarchical basis.
